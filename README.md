Custom OS X services that make my life easier.

## Services

### Copy Message Link

Copies a link to the currently-selected message in Mail.app.

### Copy Public Dropbox Link

Service-based version of [cdzombak/qs-public-dropbox-link](https://github.com/cdzombak/qs-public-dropbox-link).

### Generate QR Code

Generates a QR code from the selected text.

### Open URL

Asks for a URL and opens it in the system default application.

### Play Fax Sound

Pauses iTunes and Spotify if they’re running, then ensure volume isn’t muted and plays [this fax sound](fax_call_loop.wav).

Answer automated phone calls with this to get yourself removed from autodialer lists.

### Scale Images

Scales the selected images by a given amount (default 50%) and puts the results on the Desktop.

## Requirements

I currently use these on OS X 10.10. They probably work on other similar OS X versions.
